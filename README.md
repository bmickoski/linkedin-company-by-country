**_NOTE_**

In this project I am using LinkedIn Company Search Scraper from https://console.apify.com/actors/UhgxM3xZ8HL7l1nK7#/console. In http.ts file there is **BACKEND_COMPANY_URL** and **APIFY_KEY** that points to this LinkedIn Company Search. **APIFY_KEY** is key generated with test account and we have trial time that last only 3 days. After this days we must upgrade to PRO which is paid. So if this app is tested after this trial period user who is using this app will need to next:

1. Create account on https://console.apify.com/sign-in
2. Get API_KEY from https://console.apify.com/account?tab=integrations in Personal API TOKENS section
3. This Scraper also requires LinkedIn authentication Token. Set to the value of the li_at cookie from a Web browser after a successful authentication on linkedin.com. The token expires after 1 year or after a logout from LinkedIn. (We have one valid in http.ts file already that we are using)
4. Go to https://console.apify.com/actors/UhgxM3xZ8HL7l1nK7#/console, populate Authentication Token and click on Start Trial Button
5. After this you can use this api with this auth key in this app (just don't forget to update in http.ts)


***NOTE***

Also in android folder there is local.properties file. Please change this path to your own sdk path!!
